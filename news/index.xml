      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our paper titled &amp;ldquo;Memory-bound &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mer selection for large evolutionary diverse reference libraries&amp;rdquo; has been accepted to RECOMB 2024.
Hopefully, I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Cambridge (April 29 - May 2, 2024).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have finished my thesis, titled &amp;ldquo;Automated behavioral analysis of asleep fruit fly&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; which is now available online, and obtained my MSc degree. The defense was on 26 July 2022, you can find my slides here. Jury members are listed below, I do appreciate their time and invaluable comments.

      <description>I attended to 16th Machine Learning for Computational Biology Conference (MLCB), and presented our work in progress, titled &amp;ldquo;MuDCoD: Multi-Subject Community Detection in Dynamic Gene Networks&amp;rdquo; (see my slides, note that I ended up using a simplified version due to the time constraint). The 2-page long abstract is not available online, but hopefully a preprint will be soon. We also had a poster presentation on the second day.</description>
