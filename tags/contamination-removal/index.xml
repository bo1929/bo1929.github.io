		<description>KRANK has been published in Genome Research (RECOMB 2024 Special Issue). The tool is available at GitHub, together with links to pre-built indexes of varying sizes, utilizing WoL reference database and a RefSeq snapshot. Using these indexes, KRANK showed superior performance in taxonomic classification and abundance profiling on CAMI benchmarking datasets to many existing methods. I hope you find it useful! Here is the abstract:
Using k-mers to find sequence matches is increasingly used in many bioinformatic applications, including metagenomic sequence classification.</description>

		<title>basty for Behavioral Analysis of Sleep in *Drosophila melanogaster*</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying animal behavior is the main objective of the field of computational ethology, and is not an straightforward task. From a purely computational point of view, the task can be seem as mapping spatiotemporal features (e.g., changes and postures) to behavioral categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<title>I attended RECOMB 2024 and presented KRANK</title>

		<description>I gave a talk on KRANK in RECOMB 2024. My slides are available here.
In summary:
This was my first time visiting Boston, and I enjoyed it very much. I think the organization was much better last year, in Istanbul. Poster sessions are definitely the best place to meet relevant people. Being the first speaker early in the morning was unfortunate, many people missed the entire (or a considerable portion) talk.</description>

		<description>I am primarily interested in sequence analysis in the context of metagenomics and phylogenetics. I develop tools that target efficient analysis of large-scale genomic datasets. Some examples are:
CONSULT-II &amp;ndash; using locality-sensitive hashing for taxonomic identification
KRANK &amp;ndash; memory-bound and taxonomy-aware k-mer selection algorithm
krepp &amp;ndash; reads to genome distance estimation and phylogenetic placement
I also briefly worked in network analysis: see our community detection method for dynamic gene co-expression networks (MuDCoD &amp;ndash; community detection in multi-subject dynamic networks from scRNA-seq data).</description>

		<title>CONSULT-II has been (finally) published in Bioinformatics</title>
		<link>https://bo1929.github.io/news/published-paper-in-bioinformatics-2024/</link>

		<description>After a long review process, CONSULT-II finally appeared in Bioinformatics. I think CONSULT-II is conceptually very exciting but as a software I am not very proud of it. The implementation is very eclectic and not user-friendly at all. Luckily, I was able to re-implement it for KRANK, and KRANK&amp;rsquo;s software offers the same functionality with an improved user experience and increase speed. Another thing is that, CONSULT-II consists of many heuristics that there are alternatives for.</description>

		<title>MuDCoD has been published in Bioinformatics</title>
		<link>https://bo1929.github.io/news/published-paper-in-bioinformatics-2023/</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
		
		<guid>https://bo1929.github.io/news/published-paper-in-bioinformatics-2023/</guid>
		<description>We published a paper in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we developed a new approach for community detection in multi-subject and dynamic networks, in particular networks constructed from scRNA-seq data. The abstract is given below, and see the figure for an illustration of what multi-subject and dynamic networks refer to.
Motivation: With the wide availability of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, population-scale scRNA-seq datasets across multiple individuals and time points are emerging. While the initial investigations of these datasets tend to focus on standard analysis of clustering and differential expression, leveraging the power of scRNA-seq data at the personalized dynamic gene co-expression network level has the potential to unlock subject and/or time-specific network-level variation, which is critical for understanding phenotypic differences.</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Relying on locality-sensitive hashing, CONSULT-II k-mers from a query set and tests whether they fall within a user-specified hamming distance of k-mers in the reference dataset. Using this invaluable information, it can remove contamination, i.e., reads that do not belong to the reference set, at least predicted to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Consider a lattice, where we place pebbles with probability $p$ at each intersection.
Neighboring pebbles are considered to be connected, forming clusters of size two or more.
We are mainly interested in sizes of these clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
